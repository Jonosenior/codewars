# Codewars Problem Sets

This is a collection of my solutions to coding problems on CodeWars, which the site calls 'katas', along with notes on many of my solutions.

> In our dojo, kata are real code challenges focused on improving skill and technique. Some train programming fundamentals, while others focus on complex problem solving.

Players and problems are ranked, with new users / easy problems assigned a rating of 8 kyu, where 1 kyu is the best user / hardest problem.
